  <h1>Hi, I’m Alberto.</h1>
  <p>I’m a software developer who thinks in systems. I care about clarity, structure and long-term thinking.</p>
  <p>I’m drawn to things that reveal how systems actually work, in code and beyond.</p>
  <p>I like understanding my tools well enough to shape them. I built my own PC, run a Raspberry Pi setup with Pi-hole, and modded a mechanical keyboard to feel exactly right.</p>

  <p>Right now I work with React and JavaScript in production, while steadily expanding into AWS and cloud engineering.</p>
  <p>This site is where I break down what I learn to uncover the principles behind it; the structure, the patterns, and the ideas that make things work.</p>
  <p>If any of that resonates with you, you might enjoy my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, or you can start with <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
