<Layout title="About">
  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>I like understanding how things work and making them better. I enjoy building, fixing and simplifying, whether it is writing code, configuring a system or repairing something at home. I get a lot of satisfaction from useful work done with care.</p>

  <p>I grew up between Argentina, the Netherlands and Spain, moving between languages and cultures. That taught me to adapt fast, stay curious and find underlying commonalities and differences.</p> 
  
  <p>Before becoming a developer I studied law, and what stayed with me from that time was a habit of thinking. Look at the system, question assumptions, foucs on the real problem. Programming uses the same mindset with a clearer feedback loop.</p>

  <p>I care about clarity and progress. I like work that is practical, honest and built to last. Small improvements done consistently over time are what build the greatest things.</p>

  <p>This site is where I write to think. I use it to document what I learn and explore ideas about code, tools, systems, learning and craft.</p>

  <p>I live in Spain with my partner and two foster children. When I am not coding or writing, I am usually tinkering with a side project, training or making a good coffee.</p>
