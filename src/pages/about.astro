  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>At heart, I’m both a thinker and a tinkerer. I get a lot of satisfaction from building things, repairing them, and finding ways to make them work better, both in the physical and digital plane. I’ve swapped the SSD on my PS4, set up a Pi-hole, modded mechanical keyboards, and built my first PC after more than a decade of dreaming about it. For me, tinkering isn’t just about fixing something. It is about understanding systems, solving problems with the tools I have, and enjoying the process of keeping things alive and optimized.</p>
  
  <p>I grew up between cultures. I was born in Argentina, moved to the Netherlands as a baby, and later to Spain at twelve. My mother is Argentinian, my father is Dutch, and I have lived most of my life across languages and contexts. I grew up speaking Dutch, learned English as a child, picked up Spanish later, and I never felt the need to choose just one identity. Instead, I am comfortable being a little bit from everywhere.</p>
  
  <p>For a while, I followed the path of law. What drew me in was not so much the rules but the dialectic. I enjoyed exploring different arguments, weighing perspectives, and showing why something mattered. It was about painting the picture that made sense of complexity. That same mindset of exploring, structuring, and asking what really holds is what eventually pulled me into programming.</p>
  
  <p>Along the way I also discovered how much I enjoy the social side of things. I went to public speaking classes and debate school, and I love talking with people face to face. I am curious about how others see the world, and I enjoy exchanging ideas in conversation as much as I enjoy exploring them on my own. This is as much a part of who I am as tinkering with systems.</p>
  
  <p>Now I am focused on programming. What I love is not just writing code but understanding how pieces fit together. I want to know how modules interact, what principles underlie good design, and how structure creates clarity. To me, programming feels like the natural continuation of the tinkering I have always done, only at a bigger scale.</p>
  
  <p>This site is my creative outlet. It is where I write to clarify my own thinking and to share what I find along the way. Sometimes that means going deep on coffee brewing, or strength training, or the details of a PC build. Other times it is more reflective, about learning, about systems, about what these practices mean for us. In the end, what ties it all together is curiosity, and the belief that by looking closely at the things we do, we also learn something about who we are and who we are becoming.</p>
  
  <p>I live in Spain with my partner and two foster children. Life is busy, but it gives me plenty of reasons to keep tinkering, reflecting, connecting, and writing.</p>
